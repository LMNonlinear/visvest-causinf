# Bayesian Comparison of Explicit and Implicit Causal Inference Strategies in Multisensory Heading Perception

This repository accompanies the manuscript by Acerbi, Dokka, Angelaki, and Ma (2017).
It includes human subjects' data and the code used for fitting and comparing the models reported in the paper.

We will soon post more detailed instructions on how to use this code to reproduce our results.
